 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Classifiers

This project implements various machine learning classifiers to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Due to class imbalance, the dataset is balanced using several techniques, and models are evaluated using multiple metrics to find the most effective solution.

 Models Used
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- AdaBoost

 Data Balancing Techniques
- Random Oversampling
- Random Undersampling
- SMOTE

 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- AUC-ROC
- Confusion Matrix
